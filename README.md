The Entelect Challenge is an annual coding competition where students, professional developers, and enthusiasts develop an intelligent bot to play a game. In this repository, Greedy algorithm is used to design the bot.
There are 3 main strategies that are implemented in this bot:
1. Movement based on enemies' health and distance priority
2. Weapon selection based on utilities
3. Health pack strategy

* Install the **Java SE Development Kit 8** for your environment here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
* Make sure **JAVA_HOME system variable** is set, Windows 10 tutorial here: https://www.mkyong.com/java/how-to-set-java_home-on-windows-10/
* Install **IntelliJ IDEA** here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/

## Setup
**Configuring the game and runner**

Simply edit the game-config.json and game-config-runner.json in the main folder.

**Modifying the bot**
1. Make your modifications to the starter bot using IntelliJ. 
2. Once you are happy with your changes, package your bot by opening up the "Maven Projects" tab on the right side of the screen. 
3. From here go to the "java-sample-bot" > "Lifecycle" group and double-click "Install" This will create a .jar file in the folder called "target". 
4. The file will be called "java-sample-bot-jar-with-dependencies.jar".

**Running**

Simply run (double-click) the "run.bat" file, or open up Command Prompt in the starter pack's root directory and run the "run.bat" command.
